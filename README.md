# "Disclosure of Neurodivergence in Software Workplaces: a Mixed Methods Study of Forum and Survey Perspectives"
Repository for "Get Me In The Groove: A Mixed Methods Study on Supporting ADHD Programmers," to be published at ASSETS 2025.

# Paper Abstract 
Deciding whether to disclose neurodivergence at work is hard; disclosing can lead to positive outcomes, but also to stigma or job insecurity. These outcomes are hard to predict and not well understood. Accordingly, neurodivergent workers turn to online communities, which may not inform well-calibrated disclosure decisions. We conducted a mixed-methods study on disclosure of neurodivergence in software workplaces. We focus on software workplaces because neurodivergence is prevalent there, and they present unique interactions for disclosure. We compare community perceptions on r/ADHD_Programmers with a worldwide survey of 493 software engineers. Synthesizing these perspectives, we constructed a model of disclosure in our context, uncovering the cost-benefit analyses of disclosure, disclosure outcomes, and the influence of mental health. We found that workplace disclosure is often motivated by social support and outcomes are predominantly positive. We conclude with a call for future interventions, including technologies, to optimize disclosure decisions.
