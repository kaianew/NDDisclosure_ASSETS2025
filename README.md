Hello, interested reviewers! Welcome to the replication package for our paper, "Disclosure of Neurodivergence in Software Workplaces: a Mixed Methods Study of Forum and Survey Perspectives."

What you will find in this package:
  -- Qualitative Analysis and Data
    Contains: A Data folder with all 99 threads we analyzed, our final codebook for this project, and a spreadsheet indicating who did which passes in our three-pass thematic analysis (anonymized).
  -- Quantitative Analysis and Data
    Contains: Data (in final_cleaned.csv), our survey instrument, standard_cleaning.R, for consistency checks and to clean data, and Rmd and knitted HTML files showing analysis results. Our main analysis script is in ASSETS_main_analysis.Rmd.
  -- Scraping Scripts
    Contains: Scripts we used to scrape and format Reddit posts and to look for public GitHub emails for survey recruitment.

While we cannot publicly publish our data for privacy reasons -- including both the posts and comment threads from r/ADHD_Programmers and survey responses from our participants -- we plan to publish all other information in a public GitHub repository, should the paper be accepted. We will allow access to our data upon request and to reviewers during the review process, in accordance with our IRB.
