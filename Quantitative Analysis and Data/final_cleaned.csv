I am extremely good at debugging, apparently. I think it is my ability to focus that helps.

I have also learned that I am apparently a ""superprogrammer"" that can work 4x as fast as my peers. I think it is because I simply refuse to take breaks and/or have the discipline to stay focused.

Why do I think I am good at them?

designing & implementing larger patterns/systems:

designing & implementing accessible UI/UX:
UI/UX is how the devs/company communicate with the user in realtime, using pre-programmed behaviors. I get to explore the endless landscape of communication to find ways to effectively get users to understand what we want the app to tell them, and to understand what they're doing.
As an Autistic/ADHD/Dyslexic person, effective and clear communication is critically important to me.

I think this work is underrecognized and undervalued: many people want to do something new or start/prototype something, then move on. Maintenance work is very challenging because diffs (red/green) and understanding the system behavior and implications of changes is a lot more challenging to work with than just a greenfield project. However, greenfield does require being OK making mistakes/being messy and just getting it out there, in addition to some creativity and design.

The problem is that it's hard to advocate for maintenance work at times, since many people don't inherently understand the value of keeping a money-making system well maintained, nor the difficulties of dealing with technical debt.

I think I excel in maintaining complex systems because I am able to grasp the system as a whole and weigh changes and processes against that knowledge base with relative ease.

With a lot of freedom. No dailies. Doing features that are actually needed and are to be used as soon as they are pushed to prod.
Role & tasks:
Anything I can do or able to pick up quickly.
More of a coding guy, not good at stuff like Figma but fine implementing frontend.
Backend's fine as well.

Why?
I just like to see things completed and have an impact.

My colleagues appreciate what I do with the codebase but I deliberately try not to overdo it so that I'm not seen as a stickler for code quality. I do pay attention to the Lint hints in the IDE and I'm often surprised others don't. I don't comment on it though, I just suggest the changes in code reviews. I am not particularly quick at grasping new concepts or solving problems at scale, but that's probably due to my ADD. I'm always impressed how my colleagues are able to see things form bird's eye view. I excel at the nitty gritty at code level only. Hence I always feel like I'm behind in system design. This is probably also I always failed interviews which include data structures and algorithms becuase they require quick fire answers and the ability to think about abstract things at short period of time. I see myself as a principled developer but within a niche. I interviewed once at Google and Facebook and failed spectacularly. I've never been invited back. It hurt, but I hadn't told them about my neurodiversity as I have always kept it close to my chest since the diagnosis in 2013. I digress!

I was diagnosed at 31 yo but since 19yo I had developed lots of coping mechanisms for my ""faults"" and weaknesses so I'd already learned how to hide some things. If there is one negative thing in the recent years of talking about ADD/ADHD is that it seemingly became almost hip and cool to be neurodiverse and there are lost of fake diagnoses which people get and then are prescribed the drugs forever leading to frequent shortages. I genuinely need my drugs. When I don't take them my work and family life suffer. I wish people were being properly diagnosed and regularly re-diagnosed for the benefit of all. not sure if that's what this question was about now! ok is software dev good for neurodiversity - 100% it is, but there is a limit to our abilities.
